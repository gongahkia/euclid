# Euclid example document

## Hello

Euclid extends Markdown with an intuitive syntax for mathematical expressions.

## Body

Euclid supports common constants such as PI, E, I, GAMMA and PHI.

We can even write out operations like 2 + 3 * pow(2, 3), sqrt(3, 27) with 7 \\ 8 and they will all render nicely.

## Goodbye

Thanks for sticking around!

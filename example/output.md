# Euclid example document

## Hello

Euclid extends Markdown with an intuitive syntax for mathematical expressions.

## Body

Euclid supports common constants such as $\pi$, $e$, $i$, $\gamma$, and $\phi$.

We can even write out operations like $2 + 3 * 2^3$, $\sqrt[3]{27}$ with $\frac{7}{8}$ and they will all render nicely.

## Goodbye

Thanks for sticking around!
